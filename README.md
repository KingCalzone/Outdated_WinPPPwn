All this tool basically does is some well needed automations for those of us without a Pi or Ethernet adapters on hand...
Personally my wires are a headache to get to and a friend of mine recently discovered you can just disable and re-enable your ethernet instead of unplugging/replugging it in( Thanks Proton :D )!

Go and make some coffee while it runs, start to roll a spliff, something nice, the longest this has taken for me was roughly 40 seconds!
