Main purpose: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To launch the exploit after automatically disabling and then re-enabling the ethernet cable connected to your ps4 by launching my exe named: 'PPPwn.exe'.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Benefits:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All of the perks of the C++ version, this is hands free, possible to set this tool as a startup app if you wish & if you have a dedicated PPPoe connection constantly plugged in.

(edit Form1.cs and ensure 'enp0s3' is the correct interface for you to use if you encounter any problems).

You can also manually update the exe this tool launches if a new version above PPPwn v1.7 is released, please refer to the comments i made in Form1.cs.

All this tool basically does is some well needed automations for those of us without a Pi or Ethernet adapters :(... i have us covered!

Personally my wires are a headache to get to and a friend of mine found out that you can just disable and re-enable your ethernet instead of unplugging/plugging it back in!

Go and make some coffee while it runs, start to roll a spliff, something nice, the longest this has taken for me was roughly one minute however it is yet to fail on memory encryption and i also have a not so great/up to date pc so you should be faster! Everything required is provided, no packages or cheats are provided. 

Please enjoy! :) - KingCalzone <3
