Main purpose: Launch PPPwn exploit after automatically disabling, waiting and re-enabling the connected ethernet cable to the ps4 via my 'PPPwn.exe'
Benefits: Hands free, possible to run this tool as a startup app if you set that up & if you have a permanent PPPoe setup! (edit src and check 'enp0s3' is the correct interface to use for you)

All this tool basically does is some well needed automations for those of us without a Pi or Ethernet adapters on hand...
Personally my wires are a headache to get to and a friend of mine found out that you can just disable and re-enable your ethernet instead of unplugging/plugging it back in ( Thanks Proton :D ) <3

Go and make some coffee while it runs, start to roll a spliff, something nice, the longest this has taken for me was roughly 40 seconds! Everything required is provided, no homebrew is provided.
